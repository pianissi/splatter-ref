Small work in progress project using React that allows images to be collaged together, typically used for collating references.

Basically just me testing around with Framer, Tailwind, and Next.js.

## Things it can do
* Drag and drop an image
* Move image around
* Have multiple images at once
* Resize images
* Selection border
* Locked aspect ratio resizing by pressing Shift
* Clearing the board by pressing delete

```
git clone git@github.com:pianissi/splatter-ref.git
